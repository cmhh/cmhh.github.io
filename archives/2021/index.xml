      <description>Overview I recently came across a scenario at work that would, like so many things in practice, be particularly well modelled as an ordered set of events. The messages would have a large number of uses in practice, but one would involve using them to train some sort of predictive model. Moreover, the messages would be arriving in real-time, and the patterns underpinning the messages might well change over time. Based on previous research, Kafka seemed like it would be a good fit, though I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have a huge amount of practical experience using it.</description>

      <description>Overview Apache Sedona, formerly GeoSpark, is a library that let&amp;rsquo;s us make spatial RDDs and DataFrames in Apache Spark, as well as to run spatial queries. Feature classes can get very large, and so being able to run various geoprocessing tasks in a distributed context seems worthwhile. So, in this post, we take a very brief look at Apache Sedona.
This post is not intended to provide comprehensive coverage of the features provided by Sedonaâ€“that would be pretty unrealistic for a short blog post.</description>
