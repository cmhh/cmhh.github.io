      <title>Serving PostGIS Features Over HTTP</title>

      <description>Overview I love spatial data, and I use it a LOT. My typical use case mostly involves downloading a feature class from some online source, and then using it entirely locally. If I just want to look at it, I&amp;rsquo;ll drop it in QGIS, but oftentimes I&amp;rsquo;ll load the features into a (containerised) PostGIS-enabled database. Unfortunately, many of the features I&amp;rsquo;m interested in are harder to download than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Take the Stats NZ Geographic Data Service, for example.</description>

      <title>Too Much Shiny?!</title>

      <description>--  Overview From the Shiny website:
 Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
 Shiny is a wonderful tool, providing a low-entry option for R programmers to develop single-page web applications.</description>

      <title>Agent Based Simulations with Akka</title>

      <description>Overview In this post we describe a relatively simple agent-based simulation. The simulation itself is a rough approximation of a household survey, consisting of a large collection of dwellings, in turn surveyed in a strictly face-to-face setting by one of a number of independent field collectors.
We describe the simulation in terms of the actor model, though we do so in a way that is largely agnostic with respect to programming language or actor framework.</description>
