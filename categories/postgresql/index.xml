      <description>Overview R is a wildly extensible tool, and that extensibility means it can be used in a surprising array of domains. This versatility is great, but there are times when R is just not the best tool for the job–at least not by itself. Geospatial applications are a good example. Packages such as rgdal, sf, and raster make R quite usable in this domain, but R’s largely in-memory approach can make geoprocessing tasks involving large spatial objects a little challenging.</description>
