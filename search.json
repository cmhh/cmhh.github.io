We do this by creating a simple web service in our language of choice (Scala), and then using it as a custom handler from a host Azure Function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 19, 2022\n\n\n7 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this post we look at how we create an Azure Function in Scala by making small changes to a basic Java function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 19, 2022\n\n\n20 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading spatial data to Snowflake can be a little awkward.

Same! As a solution of sorts, I wondered how easily we could make a service which could used to download features directly in a requested format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 25, 2022\n\n\n10 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny provides a low-entry option for R programmers to develop single-page web applications. But, in my opinion, it is over-used. In this post we consider where Shiny might be a good option, and where it might not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 20, 2022\n\n\n34 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this post we attempt to approximate a household survey collection as an agent-based simulation.

But maybe sometimes it’s just easier to expose data that already exists in a database. Here we consider a couple of options, PostGraphile and PostGREST, for doing just that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 14, 2021\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine an online learning scenario where we wish to update an existing model using streaming event data, say.

One possible solution is to appeal to a tile service or similar, and here we look at how we might leverage the GeoServer API to enable end-users to quickly deploy their own tile sets on-the-fly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 17, 2019\n\n\n14 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this post we look at how we can use QGIS Server to publish a range of services using WMS, WFS and WCS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 26, 2017\n\n\n6 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen making maps for display on the web, the size of the various objects being rendered can quickly become overwhelming.
