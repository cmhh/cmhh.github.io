      <description>Overview In this post we describe a relatively simple agent-based simulation. The simulation itself is a rough approximation of a household survey, consisting of a large collection of dwellings, in turn surveyed in a strictly face-to-face setting by one of a number of independent field collectors.
We describe the simulation in terms of the actor model, though we do so in a way that is largely agnostic with respect to programming language or actor framework.</description>
