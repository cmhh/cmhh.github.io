      <description>Overview X13-ARIMA-SEATS is a widely used seasonal adjustment program developed by the United States Census Bureau. It’s a command-line tool, and I’ve wondered whether it would be useful to run as a web service–where I work, the standard security model makes running command-line tools a little problematic, so running a single service that could be accessed by any other client remotely would seem, on the face of it, as useful proposition.</description>
