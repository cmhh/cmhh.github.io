      <description>Overview I often find myself needing to establish the travel time or distance between arrays of addresses. In the past I have used ArcMap’s Network Analyst tool, but have found the syntax to be clunky at best, and the performance to be very mediocre. And, besides, I am often working in R and sometimes it’s nice to be able to do everything in the one environment, rather than doing the routing in Python, say, and then using the results in R.</description>
