      <description>Overview I recently came across a scenario at work that would, like so many things in practice, be particularly well modelled as an ordered set of events. The messages would have a large number of uses in practice, but one would involve using them to train some sort of predictive model. Moreover, the messages would be arriving in real-time, and the patterns underpinning the messages might well change over time. Based on previous research, Kafka seemed like it would be a good fit, though I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have a huge amount of practical experience using it.</description>
