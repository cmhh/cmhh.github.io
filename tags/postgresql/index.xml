      <description>Overview A while back I made a small data service which took time series data I scraped from the web, and used it to make a data service. I used Play Framework for the API itself, and PostgreSQL as the back-end. The service wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly complicated to put together, and I do think that building bespoke services as the need arises, rather than aiming for some sort of generic framework, can be useful.</description>

      <description>Overview R is a wildly extensible tool, and that extensibility means it can be used in a surprising array of domains. This versatility is great, but there are times when R is just not the best tool for the jobâ€“at least not by itself. Geospatial applications are a good example. Packages such as rgdal, sf, and raster make R quite usable in this domain, but R&amp;rsquo;s largely in-memory approach can make geoprocessing tasks involving large spatial objects a little challenging.</description>
