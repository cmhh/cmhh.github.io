      <description>Overview R is a wildly extensible tool, and that extensibility means it can be used in a surprising array of domains. This versatility is great, but there are times when R is just not the best tool for the jobâ€“at least not by itself. Geospatial applications are a good example. Packages such as rgdal, sf, and raster make R quite usable in this domain, but R&amp;rsquo;s largely in-memory approach can make geoprocessing tasks involving large spatial objects a little challenging.</description>

      <description>Overview Interactive web applications can be a great way to present information to a diverse audience. If your interface is well designed and intuitive, then almost anybody will be able to use it. And where data has a spatial dimension, slippy maps can be an effective way of presenting information. But sometimes the objects we want to render are a bit on the large side. This means that our web browser can struggle to render all the required features, and it also means that mobile users of an app might end up using excessive amounts of data.</description>
