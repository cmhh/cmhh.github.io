      <description>--  Overview From the Shiny website:
 Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.
 Shiny is a wonderful tool, providing a low-entry option for R programmers to develop single-page web applications.</description>

      <description>Introduction R packages can include datasets, and it is very common to do so. This shouldn’t really come as a surprise–R is a statistical language in the end, and it is normal to include working examples with pacakges; and including datasets against which to run unit tests and other examples is clearly a useful thing to do.
But datasets themselves aren’t central to most packages–statistical methodologies often are, and the data is there for testing or illustrative purposes.</description>
