      <description>Overview I was recently running a process mostly using Spark SQL, but at one point ended up collecting a large DataFrame and converting it to a standard Scala Map. The source was a large DataFrame containing several records for each of a number of IDs, and I needed to do some reasonably complicated processing by ID (or at least complicated enough that an efficient solution using either DataFrames or RDDs wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious to me).</description>
