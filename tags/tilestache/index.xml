      <description>Overview When making maps for display on the web, the size of the various objects being rendered can quickly become overwhelming. For example, a polygon feature class containing New Zealand Meshblocks, a set of roughly 40,000 mutually exclusive and exhaustive polygons, is more than 100MB when stored as a shapefile, but much larger uncompressed and rendered in a browser window.
There are various approaches one can take to attempt to deal with this issue, though useful solutions tend to depend on server-side processing.</description>
