      <description>Overview I love spatial data, and I use it a LOT. My typical use case mostly involves downloading a feature class from some online source, and then using it entirely locally. If I just want to look at it, I&amp;rsquo;ll drop it in QGIS, but oftentimes I&amp;rsquo;ll load the features into a (containerised) PostGIS-enabled database. Unfortunately, many of the features I&amp;rsquo;m interested in are harder to download than I&amp;rsquo;d like. Take the Stats NZ Geographic Data Service, for example.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Adjustment as a Service</title>

      <description>Overview X13-ARIMA-SEATS is a widely used seasonal adjustment program developed by the United States Census Bureau. It&amp;rsquo;s a command-line tool, and I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered whether it would be useful to run as a web serviceâ€“where I work, the standard security model makes running command-line tools a little problematic, so running a single service that could be accessed by any other client remotely would seem, on the face of it, a useful proposition.</description>
