      <description>Overview X13-ARIMA-SEATS is a widely used seasonal adjustment program developed by the United States Census Bureau. It&amp;rsquo;s a command-line tool, and I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered whether it would be useful to run as a web serviceâ€“where I work, the standard security model makes running command-line tools a little problematic, so running a single service that could be accessed by any other client remotely would seem, on the face of it, a useful proposition.</description>
